Zillow Web-Scraper
========================

About this project:
------------------------

This project is a web scraping tool which takes a Zillow URL and returns the first few listings of properties displayed in an organized manner. In the future I hope to add more features that include scraping all the listings available and sending an email regularly with newly added properties provided. 

How to use:
------------------------

1. Install selenium and beautifulsoup4
2. Check if provided chromedriver is compatible with your device, if not, download the correct version. Make sure to place this in the same folder where scraper.py is stored.
3. A sample Zillow URL is provided in scraper.py, be sure to edit it to your liking.
4. Run "python3 scraper.py"
